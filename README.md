# Automatic-Crash-gta-v
A script for 2take1 to automatically crash everyone in the lobby and then join a new one whilst concurrently spamming the chat with a customisable message.

# How to install
Take the "automatic crash.lua" and navigate to "%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\PopstarDevs\2Take1Menu\Scripts" then drag and drop the file into there.
After that load into gta and inject 2Take1, go to scripts and activate "Automatic Crash.lua" (you must enable Trusted http for auto update).
You can then navigate to script features and use the automatic crashing script.
